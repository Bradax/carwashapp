# carwashapp
This app allows car wash owners/managers to easily substitue traditional free car wash coupons/cards/tickets.

###Technologies Used
This is built using an Ionic sidemenu starter app with Angular, ngCordova, and ngStorage.

###Challenges
I'm a novice programmer, learning the MEAN stack. My challenges are: <br>
1. Unable to initilize a proper MongoDB. <br>
2. Lack of app development cycle plan. <br>
3. App isn't ready for IOS9 WebUiFix (glitchy transitions between views) <br>
4. Currently only serving end-users, intead of supporting car wash owners/managers too.

###TODO
1. [ ] Build WashesServices - A factory service that stores all washes made by user on a specific car.
2. [ ] About This App (details, contact)
3. [ ] Build a History Service that shows user history of washes in a calender repeating each calenders monthly.
4. [ ] Build a server that stores all the data, and allow car wash owners/managers to manage washes (check ins) and free washes given.

Any help will be deeply appreciated.
